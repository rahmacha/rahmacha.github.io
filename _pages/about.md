I am Rahma, a Ph.D. candidate at Facebook AI Research and ENS Ulm, advised by [Prof. Marco Baroni](http://marcobaroni.org/) and [Prof. Emmanuel Dupoux](http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/). 

I am interested in understanding what made our natural language unique and how we can endow artificial models with such a communication protocol. To this end, I use deep learning techniques, building upon the emergent communication protocol to compare deep learner languages with human languages. More recently, I have been focusing on looking at deep learners' inductive biases and how to inject the "right" biases in these task-agnostic models.

Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.S. and Master of Applied Mathematics degree from Supelec and a DataScience master's degree from Ecole Polytechnique. You can find more information in my [CV](https://github.com/rahmacha/rahmacha.github.io/blob/master/CV_github.pdf).
